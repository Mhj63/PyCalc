# pycalc: A Python Calculator

## Description

**pycalc** is a simple Python calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. This project serves as a practical implementation of fundamental programming concepts and constructs learned during the foundation year at Bahrain Polytechnic.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first number.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second number, with a check to prevent division by zero.
- **Exponentiation**: Raises the first number to the power of the second number.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures that inputs are valid integers and provides appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pycalc.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd pycalc
    ```

3. Run the calculator:
    ```sh
    python pycalc.py
    ```
